The answer is 40 Choose 20
Every path from top-left to bottom-right is a sequence of steps.
A step can be either right (R) or down (D).
Thus, a path going along the top and then down the right edge would be: RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Another valid path would be RRRDDRDDDRRRRDDRDDDRRRRDDRDDDRRRRDDRDDDR.
Essentially, each path must contain 20 Rs and 20 Ds.  But these can be in any order.

So we can reduce the problem to: How many ways can we arrange 20 Rs and 20 Ds?
Or: out of 40 spots, how many ways can we choose 20 spots?
